This is code for the end of course 3 tidy data for the coursera Data Science 
specialization. 

Make sure the top level directory for the data set is in your current working directory. 
From that point, you may execute the script from the working directory.  The final ouput of the 
script should be written to tidy_data.txt.  

cheers!
